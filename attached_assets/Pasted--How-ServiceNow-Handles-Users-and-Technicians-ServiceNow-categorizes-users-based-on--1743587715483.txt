### **How ServiceNow Handles Users and Technicians**  

ServiceNow **categorizes users** based on their roles and responsibilities. The platform ensures that **end-users, technicians, and administrators** have appropriate access to perform their tasks.

## **1️⃣ User Roles & Access Management**
ServiceNow controls **who can access what** through **user roles and permissions**. Below are the primary user categories:

| **User Type**       | **Role & Responsibility**                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **End Users (Employees/Requesters)** | Create incidents, request services, check status, and receive notifications. |
| **IT Technicians (Support Agents)** | Work on tickets (Incidents, Requests, Problems, Changes). |
| **IT Admins (Managers, Approvers)** | Approve changes, assign tickets, and manage workflows. |
| **ServiceNow Administrators** | Full access to configure and customize the platform. |

### **🔹 User Profiles**
Each user has a profile stored in the **User Table (sys_user)** that includes:
- **User ID**
- **Email**
- **Department**
- **Role(s) Assigned**
- **Manager Name**
- **Group Memberships** (Support groups, Approval groups)

## **2️⃣ Handling Users (End Users)**
End users interact with ServiceNow **via the Self-Service Portal** to:
- Report **Incidents**
- Submit **Service Requests**
- Track their ticket **status**
- View **knowledge base articles** for self-help
- Receive **automated notifications** (ticket updates)

🔹 **Authentication**: Users can log in via **LDAP, SSO (Single Sign-On), or Active Directory** integration.  
🔹 **Restricted Access**: End users **cannot view or modify** other users' tickets (only their own).

## **3️⃣ Handling Technicians (Support Agents)**
Technicians handle **Incidents, Requests, Problems, and Changes**.
